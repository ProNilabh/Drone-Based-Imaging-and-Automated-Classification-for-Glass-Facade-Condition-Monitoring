# Drone-Based-Imaging-and-Automated-Classification-for-Glass-Facade-Condition-Monitoring
Glass facade inspections are traditionally time-consuming, costly, and unsafe, especially for high-rise buildings. This research proposes an automated system that integrates drone-based imaging, image stitching, and YOLO-based object detection for real-time monitoring of glass facades.
